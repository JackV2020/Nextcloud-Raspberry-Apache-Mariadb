----- can not be downloaded because of local file name clash!

In the client Settings window with the folder structure you see the message :

    'server file name : File local file name' can not be downloaded because of local file name clash

On the client go to the folder of the file and see :


'local file name' with a red ball and a white cross

and also

'local file name'.~xyz with a yellow ball and a white exlamation mark !

~xyz can be anything but starts with a ~

Do not touch 'local file name'.~xyz

Move 'local file name' to a location outside that specific nextcloud folder and sync again.

The other folder may be any folder, even a nextcloud folder.

After the successful sync the file arrived from the server and you can delete the moved file.

'local file name'.~xyz disappears by itself.
