Below are my notes on installing NextCloud and solving all issues on the Administration settings Overview page.

Starting situation is a Raspberry Pi 4 running a clean installation of Bullseye.

Installation was started using https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-NextCloud-server/ where some things were missing.

My notes below have these missing things in it.

Install mariadb, apache, php and NextCloud.

After this check the Overview on the Administration page and solve all issues to beome green.


----- Installation

Start a terminal as user pi and install apache :

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade -y

	sudo apt install apache2

Start a browser and check to see http://localhost/

Add a third-party PHP repository
    sudo apt install lsb-release
    curl https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/suryphp-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/suryphp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sury-php.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install php8.1 php8.1-gd php8.1-sqlite3 php8.1-curl php8.1-zip php8.1-xml php8.1-mbstring php8.1-mysql php8.1-bz2 php8.1-intl php8.1-smbclient php8.1-imap php8.1-gmp php8.1-bcmath libapache2-mod-php8.1

sudo service apache2 restart

Install mariadb :

	sudo apt install mariadb-server

	sudo mysql_secure_installation
	enter
	Y all the time
	password S......
	password S......
	enter enter until ......
	Thanks for using MariaDB!

Create database :

	sudo mysql -u root -p

	CREATE DATABASE NextClouddb;
	CREATE USER 'NextClouduser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'S....';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON NextClouddb.* TO 'NextClouduser'@'localhost';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	quit;


Install NextCloud (which was 25.0.4 at the time of installation):

	cd /var/www/
	sudo wget https://download.NextCloud.com/server/releases/latest.tar.bz2

	sudo tar -xvf latest.tar.bz2

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/nextcloud/

I have an USB disk mounted on /mnt/Share0 and this is where I will put the NextCloud data :

	sudo mkdir /mnt/Share0/NextCloud

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /mnt/Share0/NextCloud

	sudo chmod 750 /mnt/Share0/NextCloud


Initial creation of Virtual host 
( modified several times later to solve issues or add functionality ) :
( geany is my favorite editor)

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf &

(Note the line with the Alias, this was not there on https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-NextCloud-server/ )

<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/nextcloud/
  ServerName 192.168.2.4
#  ServerAlias localhost
#  ServerAlias veraart.onthewifi.com
#  ServerAlias veraart.thehomeserver.net
  
  Alias /NextCloud "/var/www/nextcloud/"

  <Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
    Require all granted
    AllowOverride All
    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

    <IfModule mod_dav.c>
      Dav off
    </IfModule>
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

save file

Activate the virtual host :

	sudo a2ensite NextCloud.conf
	sudo systemctl reload apache2

Logon to NextCloud to create management account and configuration on the Raspberry Pi :

	http://192.168.2.4/NextCloud

	NextCloudMgt
	password for management account
    open 'Storage & database'
	/mnt/Share0/NextCloud
    MySQL/MariaDB
	NextClouduser
	password for db user S....
	NextClouddb
	localhost

I did not install recommended apps because I just want to sync files

Wait to be logged on to your NextCloud website.

Read welcome info or click cross/close top right corner to close the message.

Click circle image with letter in it in the top right corner.

Click Administration Setting.
Click Overview in the left pane.
See lots of messages to be dealt with later. This is the page where we want to see a green mark indicating the configuration is fine.
We are running Version NextCloud Hub 3 (25.0.4)

The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.
Accessing site insecurely via HTTP. You are strongly advised to set up your server to require HTTPS instead, as described in the security tips ↗.
Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/webfinger". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/nodeinfo". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/caldav". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/carddav". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
You have not set or verified your email server configuration, yet. Please head over to the Basic settings in order to set them. Afterwards, use the "Send email" button below the form to verify your settings.
Your installation has no default phone region set. This is required to validate phone numbers in the profile settings without a country code. To allow numbers without a country code, please add "default_phone_region" with the respective ISO 3166-1 code ↗ of the region to your config file.
No memory cache has been configured. To enhance performance, please configure a memcache, if available. Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
The PHP module "imagick" is not enabled although the theming app is. For favicon generation to work correctly, you need to install and enable this module.


We first do some other things :

---------- Increasing NextCloud’s Max Upload Size

sudo geany /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini &
Find :
post_max_size = 8M
upload_max_filesize = 2M
Change :
post_max_size = 21G
upload_max_filesize = 20G

I read that post_max_size should be larger than upload_max_filesize because of protocol overhead and that 
files are not sent as they are but encoded to Base64 for transport which makes the total transport about 35% bigger than the original file.
So the settings seem to be for 20GB but it is less.

---------- Install ssl for apache

Create folder :

	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apache2/ssl

Generate certificate valid for 3650 days :: 10 years

	sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt

	Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:NL
	State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Zeeland
	Locality Name (eg, city) []:Tholen
	Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Private
	Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Private
	Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Private
	Email Address []:arealmailaddress@someprovider.somethingelse

Enable ssl module :

	sudo a2enmod ssl

Configure apache for certificate :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf &

Change :

SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

to :

SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key

Save file

Enable default-ssl.conf :

	sudo a2ensite default-ssl.conf
	sudo service apache2 restart

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : https://yourservernameoraddress/ and accept risk :-)



Now force all traffic to apache to go to https :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Comment out all active lines by putting ##### in front and put next at top :
( I use ##### so I can later see what I commented out extra to evrything else commented out already )

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerAdmin example@example

   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>

save file

Enable rewrite module and restart apache :

	sudo a2enmod rewrite
	sudo service apache2 restart

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : http://yourservernameoraddress/
Should be redirected to https.

https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-NextCloud-server/ does not mention that you have to change the port 80 of the virtualhost to 443.

Now change port 80 in /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf to 443 and browse to http://192.168.2.4/NextCloud

------------- php info

It is good to have some info on php like the name of your config file.

sudo geany /var/www/html/info.php

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

save file

Start a browser to http://localhost/info.php

Should be redirected to https and gives info like : 

row 6 :	Loaded Configuration File 	/etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini


------------- php default version

To set the default version for the php command you use the update-alternatives command :

update-alternatives --display php

shows some info including a link to the current version

To change the version :

update-alternatives --config php
There are 2 choices for the alternative php (providing /usr/bin/php).

  Selection    Path             Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/bin/php8.2   82        auto mode
  1            /usr/bin/php8.1   81        manual mode
* 2            /usr/bin/php8.2   82        manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:

Make the right choice here and select 1 so all nextcloud related php cli commands by user www-data use 8.1 and not 8.2

---------- Configure the ISP router

You will need to port forward two ports to finally have NextCloud up and running. 
These two ports being Port 80 and Port 443. 
The protocol required for these is TCP.
In my router I need to create  :
	- an application for HTTP port 80 TCP
	- an application for HTTPS port 443 TCP
	- a forwarding for application HTTP to my Raspberry Pi
	- a forwarding for application HTTPS to my Raspberry Pi

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : http://yourpublicipaddressorhostname/
Should be redirected to https.

---------- Enable some domain names to prepare for access from Internet

You want a domain name on the Internet. Free services are available for that.

I use https://freedns.afraid.org/ and https://www.noip.com/ but many are available.

Enable your NextCloud server to accept some domain names :

	sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php

Change :
  'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => 'localhost',
  ),


To :

 'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => '1.2.3.4',
    1 => 'localhost',
    2 => 'domain.name.two',
    3 => 'domain.name.etc',
  ),

Note that 1.2.3.4 is the address of your Raspberry Pi.

Add the next in /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf

  ServerAlias localhost
  ServerAlias domain.name.two
  ServerAlias domain.name.three

systemctl restart apache2

and we have access from the Internet.

------------ solving issues :

Here are the issues I ran into right after installation and some other things.

Logon to your NextCloud website. 

https://veraart.onthewifi.com/NextCloud/index.php/settings/admin/overview

Add a second account as admin account. (just to be sure)

Click Administrative setting.
Click Overview in the left pane.
See lots of messages :

Security & setup warnings
It's important for the security and performance of your instance that everything is configured correctly. To help you with that we are doing some automatic checks. Please see the linked documentation for more information.

There are some errors regarding your setup.

    1) The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.
    2) You are accessing your instance over a secure connection, however your instance is generating insecure URLs. This most likely means that you are behind a reverse proxy and the overwrite config variables are not set correctly. Please read the documentation page about this ↗.
    3) The "Strict-Transport-Security" HTTP header is not set to at least "15552000" seconds. For enhanced security, it is recommended to enable HSTS as described in the security tips ↗.
    4) Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/caldav". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
    5) Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/carddav". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
    6) You have not set or verified your email server configuration, yet. Please head over to the Basic settings in order to set them. Afterwards, use the "Send email" button below the form to verify your settings.
    7) Your installation has no default phone region set. This is required to validate phone numbers in the profile settings without a country code. To allow numbers without a country code, please add "default_phone_region" with the respective ISO 3166-1 code ↗ of the region to your config file.
    8) No memory cache has been configured. To enhance performance, please configure a memcache, if available. Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
    9) The PHP module "imagick" is not enabled although the theming app is. For favicon generation to work correctly, you need to install and enable this module.

Please double check the installation guides ↗, and check for any errors or warnings in the log.

Check the security of your NextCloud over our security scan ↗.

Version
NextCloud Hub 3 (25.0.4)


1)----- The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.

	sudo geany /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini &

Change : memory_limit = 128M
To     : memory_limit = 512M

Save file

	sudo systemctl restart apache2

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.

2)----- You are accessing your instance over a secure connection, however your instance is generating insecure URLs. This most likely means that you are behind a reverse proxy and the overwrite config variables are not set correctly. Please read the documentation page about this ↗.

	sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php &

  'overwriteprotocol' => 'https',

	sudo systemctl restart apache2

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.

3)----- The "Strict-Transport-Security"..........

Configure some things in NextCloud.conf

	sudo -i

Check if the apache headers module is loaded :

	sudo apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES | grep head
or 	sudo apachectl -M | grep head

This shows nothing ? :

	sudo a2enmod headers
    systemctl restart apache2

Now check again :
	sudo apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES | grep head
It should say : 
	headers_module (shared)

Now change the NextCloud.conf :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf &
see :
Alias /NextCloud "/var/www/nextcloud/"

<Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
  Require all granted
  AllowOverride All
  Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

  <IfModule mod_dav.c>
    Dav off
  </IfModule>

</Directory>

change it to :


<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName 1.2.3.4
  ServerAlias localhost
  ServerAlias domain.name.one
  ServerAlias domain.name.two

    Alias /NextCloud "/var/www/nextcloud/"

    <Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride All
      Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

      <IfModule mod_dav.c>
        Dav off
      </IfModule>

    </Directory>

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains"
    </IfModule>

</VirtualHost>

save file

	sudo systemctl restart apache2

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.

4)----- and 5)----- Your web server is not properly set up to resolve......


Configure some things in NextCloud.conf

	sudo -i

	geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf &


Add the next 4 lines :

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    Redirect 301 /.well-known/carddav https://yourpublicipaddressorhostname/NextCloud/remote.php/dav
    Redirect 301 /.well-known/caldav https://yourpublicipaddressorhostname/NextCloud/remote.php/dav
    </IfModule>

or better

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/carddav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/caldav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]


Now it looks like :

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName 1.2.3.4
  ServerAlias localhost
  ServerAlias domain.name.one
  ServerAlias domain.name.two

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/carddav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/caldav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]

    Alias /NextCloud "/var/www/html/NextCloud/"

    <Directory /var/www/html/NextCloud/>
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride All
      Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

      <IfModule mod_dav.c>
        Dav off
      </IfModule>

    </Directory>

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains"
    </IfModule>

</VirtualHost>

sudo service apache2 restart

NOTE !!!!

Now the messages are gone if you logon to https://HOST/NextCloud
where HOST is ServerName or one of the ServerAlias values.


6)----- You have not set or verified your email server configuration, yet. Please head over to the Basic settings in order to set them. Afterwards, use the "Send email" button below the form to verify your settings.

Go to Administration settings, Basic Settings on the left, fill in details and test.

7)----- Your installation has no default phone region set

sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php

add :',
  'default_phone_region' => 'NL',
  
sudo systemctl restart apache2


8)----- No memory cache has been configured. To enhance performance, please configure a memcache, if available. Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.

sudo -i

php8.1 -m | grep apc
apt-get install php8.1-apcu
php8.1 -m | grep apc
phpenmod -v 8.1 apcu

geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php :

Add :
  'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',

/etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini

    [opcache]
    opcache.enable=1

    opcache.enable_cli=1

    opcache.interned_strings_buffer=8

    opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000

    opcache.memory_consumption=128

    opcache.save_comments=1

    opcache.revalidate_freq=1

systemctl restart apache2

For crontab job :

https://docs.NextCloud.com/server/25/admin_manual/configuration_server/caching_configuration.html#id1

APCu is disabled by default on CLI which could cause issues with NextCloud’s cron jobs. 
Please make sure you set the apc.enable_cli to 1 on your php.ini config file or 
append --define apc.enable_cli=1 to the cron job call.

Whoopsie, the location of apc.enable_cli=1 is in /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/apcu.ini which now has 2 lines only :
extension=apcu.so
apc.enable_cli=1
( Thanks to Reiner_Nippes in https://help.nextcloud.com/t/occ-wont-run-with-memcache-apcu/119724/6 )

I do not need --define apc.enable_cli=1 in the crontab job like I did before :

crontab -u www-data -l

# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
#
#0  12  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php --define apc.enable_cli=1
0  12  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php

To stay green I would need to run the job every 5 minutes like :

*/5  *  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php


9)----- The PHP module "imagick" is not enabled although the theming app is. For favicon generation to work correctly, you need to install and enable this module.

php8.1 -m | grep magic
apt install php8.1-imagick
php8.1 -m | grep magic
phpenmod -v 8.1 imagick
systemctl restart apache2

-------- Add Lets Encrypt certificate

This will give you an automatic refreshing offical supported certificate so there will be no warnings anymore when you access your server over the internet.
The 3650 day certificate created before will still be used for acces via localhost and the local ip adress.
