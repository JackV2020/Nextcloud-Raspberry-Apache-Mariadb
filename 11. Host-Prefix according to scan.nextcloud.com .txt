----- Host-Prefix according to scan.nextcloud.com

On the Overview page there is an option to go to scan.nextcloud.com to check if your implementation is healthy.

It may return a Host-Prefix warning.

I decided to not fix it after reading https://help.nextcloud.com/t/security---host-prefix-cookie-setting/9740

I have read somewhere that this is due to the location of nexcloud as subdomain.
It should be accessed via https://qqq.qqq.qqq/ directly and not https://qqq.qqq.qqq/nextcloud

Did not fix this until today.
