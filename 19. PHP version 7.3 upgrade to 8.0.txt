----- PHP version 7.3 upgrade to 8.0

    These are my notes on Raspberri Pi Buster with Nextcloud Hub II (23.0.6) and mysql to upgrade PHP from 7.3 to 8.0.
    ( I can not yet upgrade my Pi to Bullseye because I am also running Domoticz which is not yet supported on Bullseye)

    On the 'Security & setup warnings' you have the next message like :

    Nextcloud 23 is the last release supporting PHP 7.3. Nextcloud 24 requires at least PHP 7.4.
    
    Somewhere else I found that 8.0 is recommended so I decided to upgrade to 8.0.

    Login as pi, like you always do.
    
    First save some info concering the current installation, just in case.

php --version | tee ~/php_version.txt

php -m | tee ~/php_mods.txt

    Create a file to show apache php info  /var/www/html/info.php 

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

    Browse to the file to give you some info.
    
http://<yourserver>/info.php

    Save the web page in a file for reference.

    Go to maintenance mode : 

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ maintenance:mode --on

    When you have an error concerning something with Memcache :
    Edit                :   /etc/php/7.3/cli/php.ini
    Add as last line    :  apc.enable_cli = 1
    Save file
    And again           : -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ maintenance:mode --on

sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl stop mysql
sudo systemctl disable apache2
sudo systemctl disable mysql

    Create image backup, restore image on new uSD card and boot new image.
    How to backup and restore an image is not part of this but you should work this way.
    When you run into issues, you can insert your old uSD card, reboot, enable and start mysql and apache2 en leave maintenance mode.
    
    After reboot of the new uSD card expand the file system.
    
sudo raspi-config
6 Advanced Options
A1 Expand Filesystem

    Leave raspi-config and reboot

    Following instructions from : https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-latest-php/
    This enables us to install any php version we want ( as long as it is supported on the OS )
    And is perfect for PHP upgrade but not complete for Nextcloud so make sure to read my notes below...
    
curl https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/suryphp-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/suryphp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sury-php.list
sudo apt update

    >>>> DO NOT 'sudo apt upgrade' to upgrade packages <<<<

sudo apt install php8.0-cli

    Create test file.
    
echo "<?php echo 'Hello World';" > test.php

    Test the file.

php8.0 test.php
    
    Should show 'Hello World'
    
    Now check if your Nextcloud required modules are there.
    
php8.0 -m

    And compare with requirements on https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#prerequisites-for-manual-installation

    I was missing some and the command to install them is :

sudo apt-get install php8.0-{curl,dom,GD,mbstring,SimpleXML,XMLReader,XMLWriter,zip,pdo_mysql,bz2,intl,exif,apcu}

    I got errors on pdo_mysql so for this I looked back in the file I saved before in ~/php_mods.txt
    and decided to replace pdo_mysql by mysqli,mysqlnd :
    
sudo apt-get install php8.0-{curl,dom,GD,mbstring,SimpleXML,XMLReader,XMLWriter,zip,mysqli,mysqlnd,bz2,intl,exif,apcu}

    This seemed to work just fine. ;-)

    Time to enable php8.0 in apache.
    
sudo a2dismod php7.3
sudo a2enmod php8.0

    This gives an error like : ERROR: Module php8.0 does not exist!
    We are missing a module so let's install that.
    
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php8.0

    Note that the output ends with 'apache2_invoke: Enable module php8.0'
    Being me, I just tried to enable it again. 
    
sudo a2enmod php8.0

    Received expected message.
    Now this works let's try to startup things.
    
sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl start apache2

    And browse to the file to give you some info
    
http://<yourserver>/info.php

    You should see php8.0 info now.
    Great so we are ready to leave maintenance mode.
    
    I had to solve 2 errors below , not sure in which order.

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ maintenance:mode --off

    When you have an error concerning something of Memcache ( history repeats itself ) :
    Edit                :   /etc/php/8.0/cli/php.ini
    Add as last line    :  apc.enable_cli = 1
    Save file
    And again           : -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ maintenance:mode --on

    When you have an error stating you are running php8.1 ( duh ? 8.1 , yes, 8.1 ) which is not supported
    Set version to 8.0  :    sudo update-alternatives --config php
    ( in the menu enter the number which is in front of the version 8.0, for me it was option 2 )
    And again           : sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ maintenance:mode --off

    Now browse to you nextcloud instance and log in and check the 'Security & setup warnings' page.
    
    It gave me ( without the numbers in front which I put there to discuss things below ) :

There are some errors regarding your setup.
1) Last background job execution ran 19 hours ago. Something seems wrong. Check the background job settings ↗.
2) The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.
3) Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/webfinger". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
4) Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/nodeinfo". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
5) The PHP module "imagick" is not enabled although the theming app is. For favicon generation to work correctly, you need to install and enable this module.
6) The PHP modules "gmp" and/or "bcmath" are not enabled. If you use WebAuthn passwordless authentication, these modules are required.
    

----- 1) Is something I am aware of. I run Nextcloud for 2 users at home and do not need something to kill my uSD card so I have :
    
crontab -u www-data -l | grep nextcloud
0  0  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php --define apc.enable_cli=1

    ( note that I have apc.enable_cli=1 on the command line above and may not need that because that is in the php.ini now )

----- 2) The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.

sudo geany /etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini &

Change : memory_limit = 128M
To     : memory_limit = 512M

Save file

	sudo systemctl restart apache2
    
----- 3) and 4) webfinger and nodeinfo
    
    I had this error before, this has something to do with APPs I do not use so I disabled the check before and do it again.

    Short description is below.
    ( For details look in my document '16. webfinger and nodeinfo message like caldav and carddav.txt'. )
    
    Edit /var/www/nextcloud/apps/settings/js/admin.js

and change lines 265 and 266 :

			OC.SetupChecks.checkWellKnownUrl('GET', '/.well-known/webfinger', OC.theme.docPlaceholderUrl, $('#postsetupchecks').data('check-wellknown') === true, [200, 404], true),
			OC.SetupChecks.checkWellKnownUrl('GET', '/.well-known/nodeinfo', OC.theme.docPlaceholderUrl, $('#postsetupchecks').data('check-wellknown') === true, [200, 404], true),

into 
			OC.SetupChecks.checkWellKnownUrl('GET', '/.well-known/webfinger', OC.theme.docPlaceholderUrl, false, [200, 404], true),
			OC.SetupChecks.checkWellKnownUrl('GET', '/.well-known/nodeinfo', OC.theme.docPlaceholderUrl, false, [200, 404], true),
                
    After this I cleaned everything in my browser cache and restarted my Raspberry Pi by init 6, and messages were gone.
    ( I just closed my Firefox which I have that setup to always browse in private mode and clean everything up to avoid cookie issues with other applications.)
    
----- 5) and 6) PHP modules were solved by :

sudo apt-get install php8.0-{imagick,gmp,bcmath}
systemctl restart apache2    

    
    Okay so far, only message 1) is on my screen and I am happy with that.
    
    On the page is also a link 'Check the security of your Nextcloud over our security scan ↗.' to https://scan.nextcloud.com
    
    I entered my url, clicked on scan, saw my old results, did a rescan and it came up with a big green A.
    
    The only message below is Host-Prefix and I am not going to do anything about that.
    
    See '11. Host-Prefix according to scan.nextcloud.com .txt' why.
    
    I hope you have a big green A too.
