Background jobs

Some jobs haven’t been executed since 2 months ago. Please consider increasing the execution frequency. 

Switched to cron and :

crontab -u www-data -e

*/5  *  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php

This casued 'some' load on my Raspberry Pi and processes took much longer than 5 minutes to run so they were running in parallel.
I could see that using the nesxt command :
    
    watch "ps -ef | grep nextcloud"

So I changed it to run once a day at 07:00 AM :

0  7  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php

I may decrease the interval in future but at this moment just once a day.
