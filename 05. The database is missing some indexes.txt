----- The database is missing some indexes

The database is missing some indexes. Due to the fact that adding indexes on big tables could take some time they were not added automatically. 
By running "occ db:add-missing-indices" those missing indexes could be added manually while the instance keeps running. 
Once the indexes are added queries to those tables are usually much faster.

Note that the message indicates that this can be done online so :

	sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ db:add-missing-indices

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.
