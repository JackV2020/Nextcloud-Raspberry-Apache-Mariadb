Starting situation is a Raspberry Pi 4 running Bullseye.

In the end this was not a success because I could not get memory chache working and there was a php module I could not install for php8.0

The notes below are not up to date because still contain older stuff but I keep this one so I can give it a try another time.

After this unsuccessful attempt I did '00. Nextcloud 22.0.0 on Raspberry Pi 4 running Buster'

So maybe better to look in that.

	Thanks for using MariaDB!

Create database :

	sudo mysql -u root -p

	CREATE DATABASE nextclouddb;
	CREATE USER 'nextclouduser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'SamAndG';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextclouddb.* TO 'nextclouduser'@'localhost';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	quit;

Install Nextcloud (which was 23.0.1 at the time of installation):

	cd /var/www/
	sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.tar.bz2

	sudo tar -xvf latest.tar.bz2

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/nextcloud/

I have an USB disk mounted on /mnt/Share0 and this is where I will put the Nextcloud data :

	sudo mkdir /mnt/Share0/NextCloud

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /mnt/Share0/NextCloud

	sudo chmod 750 /mnt/Share0/NextCloud

Initial creation of Virtual host 
( modified several times later to solve issues or add functionality ) :
( geany is my favorite editor)

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf &

Alias /nextcloud "/var/www/nextcloud/"

<Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
  Require all granted
  AllowOverride All
  Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

  <IfModule mod_dav.c>
    Dav off
  </IfModule>

</Directory>

save file

Activate the virtual host :

	sudo a2ensite nextcloud.conf
	sudo systemctl reload apache2

Logon to nextcloud to create management account and configuration on the Raspberry Pi :

	http://localhost/nextcloud

	NextCloudMgt
	password for management account
    open 'Storage & database'
	/mnt/Share0/NextCloud
    MySQL/MariaDB

We first do some other things :

---------- Increasing Nextcloud’s Max Upload Size

sudo geany /etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini
Find :
post_max_size = 8M
upload_max_filesize = 2M
Change :
post_max_size = 1024M
;upload_max_filesize = 1024M
upload_max_filesize = 4096M

sudo service apache2 restart

We first install ssl for apache and arrange Internet access.

---------- Install ssl for apache

Create folder :

	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apache2/ssl

Generate certificate valid for 3650 days :: 10 years

	sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
    
	Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:NL
	State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Zeeland
	Locality Name (eg, city) []:Tholen
	Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Private
	Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Private
	Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Private
	Email Address []:arealmailaddress@someprovider.somethingelse <-J.....

Enable ssl module :

	sudo a2enmod ssl

Configure apache for certificate :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf &

Change :

SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

to :

SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key

Save file

Enable default-ssl.conf :

	sudo a2ensite default-ssl.conf
	sudo service apache2 restart

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : https://yourservernameoraddress/ and accept risk :-)

########################################################################

Now force all traffic to apache to go to https :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Comment out all active lines by putting ##### in front and put next at top :
( I use ##### so I can later see what I commented out extra to evrything else commented out already )

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerAdmin example@example

   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>



save file

Enable rewrite module and restart apache :

	sudo a2enmod rewrite
	sudo service apache2 restart

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : http://yourservernameoraddress/
Should be redirected to https.

------------- php info

It is good to have some info on php like the name of your config file.

sudo geany /var/www/html/info.php

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

save file

Start a browser to http://localhost/info.php

Should be redirected to https and gives info like : 

row 6 :	Loaded Configuration File 	/etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini

---------- Configure the ISP router

You will need to port forward two ports to finally have Nextcloud up and running. 
These two ports being Port 80 and Port 443. 
The protocol required for these is TCP.
In my router I need to create  :
	- an application for HTTP port 80 TCP
	- an application for HTTPS port 443 TCP
	- a forwarding for application HTTP to my Raspberry Pi
	- a forwarding for application HTTPS to my Raspberry Pi

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : http://yourpublicipaddressorhostname/
Should be redirected to https.

---------- Enable some domain names to prepare for access from Internet

You want a domain name on the Internet. Free services are available for that.

I use https://freedns.afraid.org/ and https://www.noip.com/ but many are available.

Enable your nextcloud server to accept some domain names :

	sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php

Change :
  'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => 'localhost',
  ),


To :

 'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => '1.2.3.4',
    1 => 'domain.name.one',
    2 => 'domain.name.two',
    3 => 'domain.name.etc',
  ),

Note that 1.2.3.4 is the address of your Raspberry Pi.

------------ solving issues :

Here are the issues I ran into right after installation and solved.

Logon to your nextcloud website. 

https://veraart.onthewifi.com/nextcloud/index.php/settings/admin/overview

Add a second account as admin account. (just to be sure)

Click Setting.
Click Overview in the left pane.
See lots of messages :

 Security & setup warnings

It's important for the security and performance of your instance that everything is configured correctly. To help you with that we are doing some automatic checks. Please see the linked documentation for more information.

Please double check the installation guides ↗, and check for any errors or warnings in the log.

Check the security of your Nextcloud over our security scan ↗.

After solving 1 and 2 a new message comes up :
10) You are accessing your instance over a secure connection, however your instance is generating insecure URLs. This most likely means that you are behind a reverse proxy and the overwrite config variables are not set correctly. Please read the documentation page about this ↗.


1)----- The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.

	sudo geany /etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini &

Save file

	sudo systemctl restart apache2

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.

2)----- The "Strict-Transport-Security"..........

Configure some things in nextcloud.conf

	sudo -i

Check if the apache headers module is loaded :

	sudo apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES | grep head
or 	sudo apachectl -M | grep head

This shows nothing ? :

	sudo a2enmod headers

Now check again :
	sudo apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES | grep head
It should say : 
	headers_module (shared)

Now change the nextcloud.conf :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf &
see :
