----- Some columns in the database are missing a conversion to big int.

Some columns in the database are missing a conversion to big int. 
Due to the fact that changing column types on big tables could take some time they were not changed automatically. 
By running 'occ db:convert-filecache-bigint' those pending changes could be applied manually. 
This operation needs to be made while the instance is offline. 
For further details read the documentation page about this.

Note that the message indicates that this can NOT be done online so :

	sudo geany /var/www/html/nextcloud/config/config.php &
Insert maintenance mode / change to
  'maintenance' => true,

save file

	sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ db:convert-filecache-bigint

	sudo	geany /var/www/html/nextcloud/config/config.php &
Change maintenance mode to
  'maintenance' => false,

save file

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.
