Below are my notes on installing NextCloud and solving all issues on the Administration settings Overview page.

Starting situation is a Raspberry Pi 4 running a clean installation of Bookworm.

Installation was started using https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-NextCloud-server/ which was missing at the end to change port 80 to 443.

My notes below has this in it.

Install mariadb, apache, php and NextCloud.

After this check the Overview on the Administration page and solve all issues to become green.

----- Installation

Start a terminal as user pi and install apache :

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade -y

	sudo apt install apache2

Start a browser and check to see http://localhost/

sudo service apache2 restart

It is good to have some info on php like the name of your config file.

sudo geany /var/www/html/info.php

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

save file

Start a browser to http://localhost/info.php

Should be redirected to https and gives info like : 

row 7 :	Loaded Configuration File 	/etc/php/8.3/apache2/php.ini 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install mariadb :
https://mariadb.com/downloads/
download mariadb-11.4.3-debian-bookworm-arm64-debs.ta
put the file on the Raspberry Pi in /opt
sudo -i
cd /opt
tar -xvf mariadb-11.4.3-debian-bookworm-arm64-debs.tar
read README but do this to get it done:
cd mariadb-11.4.3-debian-bookworm-arm64-debs
./setup_repository

cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.list
deb file:///opt/mariadb-11.4.3-debian-bookworm-arm64-debs ./

apt-get update && apt-get install mariadb-server

-----------------------------
MariaDB Server 

This package contains a number of .deb files that together comprise the MariaDB
Server distribution.

The packages included in this archive may vary depending on the OS you're using
and its release version, as different components may require libraries or
functionality available only in newer releases. 

The .deb files can be installed individually, but there are complex
interdependencies that are difficult to resolve using dpkg alone. For that
reason, this package is distributed as a ready-to-use Debian archive, so that
you can use apt to install the packages in it.

In order for the package manager to be able to install these packages, you will
need to place them in a location that the package manager has privileges to
access. You may find that /opt is a good location where you can unpack the
archive and the package manager will be able to read it.

To use the archive with apt, create a mariadb.list file in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ that points to the directory where you've extracted
the files. A helpful script called setup_repository is included in this archive
to do this for you.

You'll need to do this work as root, so that you can write files to these
locations.

cd /opt
tar -xf ~/mariadb-11.4.3-debian-bookworm-arm64-debs.tar
mariadb-11.4.3-debian-bookworm-arm64-debs/setup_repository

After the repository is set up, you should update apt and install the
mariadb-server package.

apt-get update && apt-get install mariadb-server

If your operating system already provides its own MariaDB packages, you may
need to manually specify the version of the package you've downloaded. Version
numbers can be complicated, so you may wish to use a command such as this to
see all available versions, from which you can choose one:

# apt-cache show mariadb-server | grep Version
Version: 10.1.17+maria-1~xenial
Version: 10.0.27+maria-1~xenial
Version: 10.0.25-0ubuntu0.16.04.1
Version: 10.0.24-7
# apt-get install mariadb-server=10.0.27+maria-1~xenial

	cd /var/www/
	sudo wget https://download.NextCloud.com/server/releases/latest.tar.bz2

	sudo tar -xvf latest.tar.bz2

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/nextcloud/

I have an USB disk mounted on /mnt/Share0 and this is where I will put the NextCloud data :

	sudo mkdir /mnt/Share0/NextCloud

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /mnt/Share0/NextCloud

	sudo chmod 750 /mnt/Share0/NextCloud


Initial creation of Virtual host 
( modified several times later to solve issues or add functionality ) :
( geany is my favorite editor)

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf &

There are some errors regarding your setup.

    Accessing site insecurely via HTTP. You are strongly advised to set up your server to require HTTPS instead. Without it some important web functionality like "copy to clipboard" or "service workers" will not work! For more details see the documentation ↗.
    The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512 MB.

    Your web server is not properly set up to resolve `.well-known` URLs, failed on: `/.well-known/caldav` For more details see the documentation ↗.
    Server has no maintenance window start time configured. This means resource intensive daily background jobs will also be executed during your main usage time. We recommend to set it to a time of low usage, so users are less impacted by the load caused from these heavy tasks. For more details see the documentation ↗.
    One or more mimetype migrations are available. Occasionally new mimetypes are added to better handle certain file types. Migrating the mimetypes take a long time on larger instances so this is not done automatically during upgrades. Use the command `occ maintenance:repair --include-expensive` to perform the migrations.
    Some headers are not set correctly on your instance - The `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP header is not set (should be at least `15552000` seconds). For enhanced security, it is recommended to enable HSTS. For more details see the documentation ↗.
    Detected some missing optional indices. Occasionally new indices are added (by Nextcloud or installed applications) to improve database performance. Adding indices can sometimes take awhile and temporarily hurt performance so this is not done automatically during upgrades. Once the indices are added, queries to those tables should be faster. Use the command `occ db:add-missing-indices` to add them. Missing indices: "systag_by_objectid" in table "systemtag_object_mapping". For more details see the documentation ↗.
    The PHP OPcache module is not properly configured. The OPcache interned strings buffer is nearly full. To assure that repeating strings can be effectively cached, it is recommended to apply "opcache.interned_strings_buffer" to your PHP configuration with a value higher than "8".. For more details see the documentation ↗.

-----------------------

We first do some other things :

---------- Increasing NextCloud’s Max Upload Size

sudo geany /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini &
Find :
post_max_size = 8M
upload_max_filesize = 2M
Change :
post_max_size = 21G
upload_max_filesize = 20G

I read that post_max_size should be larger than upload_max_filesize because of protocol overhead and that 
files are not sent as they are but encoded to Base64 for transport which makes the total transport about 35% bigger than the original file.
So the settings seem to be for 20GB but it is less.

---------- Install ssl for apache

Create folder :

	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apache2/ssl

Generate certificate valid for 3650 days :: 10 years

	sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt

	Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:NL
	State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Zeeland
	Locality Name (eg, city) []:Tholen
	Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Private
	Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Private
	Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Private
	Email Address []:arealmailaddress@someprovider.somethingelse

Enable ssl module :

	sudo a2enmod ssl

Configure apache for certificate :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf &

Change :

SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

to :

SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key

Save file

Enable default-ssl.conf :

	sudo a2ensite default-ssl.conf
	sudo service apache2 restart

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : https://yourservernameoraddress/ and accept risk :-)



Now force all traffic to apache to go to https :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Comment out all active lines by putting ##### in front and put next at top :
( I use ##### so I can later see what I commented out extra to evrything else commented out already )

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerAdmin example@example

   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>

save file

Enable rewrite module and restart apache :

	sudo a2enmod rewrite
To test we need :
	sudo a2dissite Nextcloud

	sudo service apache2 restart
Start a webbrowser and check if it works : http://yourservernameoraddress/
Should be redirected to https.

https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-NextCloud-server/ does not mention that you have to change the port 80 of the virtualhost to 443.

Now change port 80 in /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf to 443
and include ssl config like :
<VirtualHost *:443>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/nextcloud/
  ServerName 192.168.2.4
#  ServerAlias localhost
#  ServerAlias veraart.onthewifi.com
#  ServerAlias veraart.thehomeserver.net
#  ServerAlias veraart.duckdns.org
#  ServerAlias veraart.mywire.org

	#   SSL Engine Switch:
	#   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
	SSLEngine on

	#   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing
	#   the ssl-cert package. See
	#   /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz for more info.
	#   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the
	#   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.
	#SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
	#SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
	SSLCertificateFile      /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
	SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key
  
  <Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
    Require all granted
    AllowOverride All
    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

    <IfModule mod_dav.c>
      Dav off
    </IfModule>
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


	sudo a2ensite Nextcloud

	sudo service apache2 restart
	
and browse to http://192.168.2.4/

------------- php info

Start a browser on the Raspberry Pi itself to http://localhost/info.php

Should be redirected to https

------------- php default version

To set the default version for the php command you use the update-alternatives command :

update-alternatives --display php

shows some info including a link to the current version

update-alternatives --display php
php - auto mode
  link best version is /usr/bin/php8.3
  link currently points to /usr/bin/php8.3
  link php is /usr/bin/php
  slave php.1.gz is /usr/share/man/man1/php.1.gz
/usr/bin/php8.3 - priority 83
  slave php.1.gz: /usr/share/man/man1/php8.3.1.gz
  
  
To change the version :

update-alternatives --config php
update-alternatives --config php
There is 1 choice for the alternative php (providing /usr/bin/php).

  Selection    Path             Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/bin/php8.3   83        auto mode
  1            /usr/bin/php8.3   83        manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:

Make the right choice here so all nextcloud related php cli commands by user www-data use the right version.
I just entered because I have just 1 version.

---------- Configure the ISP router

You will need to port forward two ports to finally have NextCloud up and running. 
These two ports being Port 80 and Port 443. 
The protocol required for these is TCP.
In my router I need to create  :
	- an application for HTTP port 80 TCP
	- an application for HTTPS port 443 TCP
	- a forwarding for application HTTP to my Raspberry Pi
	- a forwarding for application HTTPS to my Raspberry Pi

Start a webbrowser and check if it works : http://yourpublicipaddressorhostname/
Should be redirected to https.

---------- Enable some domain names to prepare for access from Internet

You want a domain name on the Internet. Free services are available for that.

I use https://freedns.afraid.org/ and https://www.noip.com/ but many are available.

Enable your NextCloud server to accept some domain names :

	sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php

Change :
  'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => 'localhost',
  ),


To :

 'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => '1.2.3.4',
    1 => 'localhost',
    2 => 'domain.name.two',
    3 => 'domain.name.etc',
  ),

Note that 1.2.3.4 is the address of your Raspberry Pi.

Add the next in /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf

  ServerAlias localhost
  ServerAlias domain.name.two
  ServerAlias domain.name.three

systemctl restart apache2

and we have access from the Internet.

I changed the next lines in /etc/redis/redis.conf to prepare for socket mode:

requirepass secret
unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis-server.sock
port 0
unixsocketperm 760

sudo systemctl restart redis

Testing redis:

First using user pi to receive an error which is just fine because pi has no rights to /run/redis/redis-server.sock
redis-cli -a secret -s /run/redis/redis-server.sock ping
Warning: Using a password with ‘-a’ or ‘-u’ option on the command line interface may not be safe.

From the root account after sudo -i

redis-cli -a secret -s /run/redis/redis-server.sock ping
Warning: Using a password with ‘-a’ or ‘-u’ option on the command line interface may not be safe.
PONG

use www-data to ping
sudo usermod -aG redis www-data
sudo -u www-data redis-cli -a secret -s /run/redis/redis-server.sock ping
Warning: Using a password with ‘-a’ or ‘-u’ option on the command line interface may not be safe.

OK

redis-cli -a secret -s /run/redis/redis-server.sock get test

“something”

So far so good, this works but now get it to work for Nextcloud.

End of /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php

‘filelocking.enabled’ => true,
‘memcache.local’ => ‘\OC\Memcache\APCu’,
‘memcache.locking’ => ‘\OC\Memcache\Redis’,

array (
‘host’ => ‘/var/run/redis/redis-server.sock’,
‘port’ => 0,

),
);

I do not think the next is neseccary :

sudo systemctl restart apache2

The next command shows redis info:

php --ri redis


9)----- No memory cache has been configured. To enhance performance, please configure a memcache, if available. Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.

sudo -i

php8.3 -m | grep apc
apt-get install php8.3-apcu
php8.3 -m | grep apc
phpenmod -v 8.3 apcu

geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php :

systemctl restart apache2

For crontab job :

https://docs.NextCloud.com/server/25/admin_manual/configuration_server/caching_configuration.html#id1

APCu is disabled by default on CLI which could cause issues with NextCloud’s cron jobs. 
Please make sure you set the apc.enable_cli to 1 on your php.ini config file or 
append --define apc.enable_cli=1 to the cron job call.

Whoopsie, the location of apc.enable_cli=1 is in /etc/php/8.3/mods-available/apcu.ini which now has 2 lines only :
extension=apcu.so
apc.enable_cli=1
( Thanks to Reiner_Nippes in https://help.nextcloud.com/t/occ-wont-run-with-memcache-apcu/119724/6 )

I do not need --define apc.enable_cli=1 in the crontab job like I did before :

crontab -u www-data -l

# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command

0  12  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php

To stay green I would need to run the job every 5 minutes like :

*/5  *  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php


10)----- Your installation has no default phone region set

sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php

Go to Administration settings, Basic Settings on the left, fill in details and test.

12)----- The PHP module "imagick" is not enabled although the theming app is. For favicon generation to work correctly, you need to install and enable this module.

Here are the issues I ran into right after installation and some other things.

Logon to your NextCloud website. 

https://veraart.onthewifi.com/index.php/settings/admin/overview

Add a second account as admin account. (just to be sure)

Click Administrative setting.
Click Overview in the left pane.
See lots of messages :

Security & setup warnings
It's important for the security and performance of your instance that everything is configured correctly. To help you with that we are doing some automatic checks. Please see the linked documentation for more information.

There are some errors regarding your setup.

    1) The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.
    2) You are accessing your instance over a secure connection, however your instance is generating insecure URLs. This most likely means that you are behind a reverse proxy and the overwrite config variables are not set correctly. Please read the documentation page about this ↗.
    3) The "Strict-Transport-Security" HTTP header is not set to at least "15552000" seconds. For enhanced security, it is recommended to enable HSTS as described in the security tips ↗.
    4) Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/caldav". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
    5) Your web server is not properly set up to resolve "/.well-known/carddav". Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
    6) You have not set or verified your email server configuration, yet. Please head over to the Basic settings in order to set them. Afterwards, use the "Send email" button below the form to verify your settings.
    7) Your installation has no default phone region set. This is required to validate phone numbers in the profile settings without a country code. To allow numbers without a country code, please add "default_phone_region" with the respective ISO 3166-1 code ↗ of the region to your config file.
    8) No memory cache has been configured. To enhance performance, please configure a memcache, if available. Further information can be found in the documentation ↗.
    9) The PHP module "imagick" is not enabled although the theming app is. For favicon generation to work correctly, you need to install and enable this module.

Please double check the installation guides ↗, and check for any errors or warnings in the log.

Check the security of your NextCloud over our security scan ↗.

Version
NextCloud Hub 3 (25.0.4)


1)----- The PHP memory limit is below the recommended value of 512MB.

	sudo geany /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini &

Change : memory_limit = 128M
To     : memory_limit = 512M

Save file

	sudo systemctl restart apache2

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.

2)----- You are accessing your instance over a secure connection, however your instance is generating insecure URLs. This most likely means that you are behind a reverse proxy and the overwrite config variables are not set correctly. Please read the documentation page about this ↗.

	sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php &

  'overwriteprotocol' => 'https',

	sudo systemctl restart apache2

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.

3)----- The "Strict-Transport-Security"..........

Configure some things in NextCloud.conf

	sudo -i

Check if the apache headers module is loaded :

	sudo apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES | grep head
or 	sudo apachectl -M | grep head

This shows nothing ? :

	sudo a2enmod headers
    systemctl restart apache2

Now check again :
	sudo apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES | grep head
It should say : 
	headers_module (shared)

Now change the NextCloud.conf :

	sudo geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf &
see :

<Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
  Require all granted
  AllowOverride All
  Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

  <IfModule mod_dav.c>
    Dav off
  </IfModule>

</Directory>

change it to :


<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName 1.2.3.4
  ServerAlias localhost
  ServerAlias domain.name.one
  ServerAlias domain.name.two

    <Directory /var/www/nextcloud/>
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride All
      Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

      <IfModule mod_dav.c>
        Dav off
      </IfModule>

    </Directory>

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains"
    </IfModule>

</VirtualHost>

save file

	sudo systemctl restart apache2

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.

4)----- and 5)----- Your web server is not properly set up to resolve......


Configure some things in NextCloud.conf

	sudo -i

	geany /etc/apache2/sites-available/NextCloud.conf &


Add the next 4 lines :

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    Redirect 301 /.well-known/carddav https://yourpublicipaddressorhostname/NextCloud/remote.php/dav
    Redirect 301 /.well-known/caldav https://yourpublicipaddressorhostname/NextCloud/remote.php/dav
    </IfModule>

or better

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/carddav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/caldav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]


Now it looks like :

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName 1.2.3.4
  ServerAlias localhost
  ServerAlias domain.name.one
  ServerAlias domain.name.two

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/carddav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/caldav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/NextCloud/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]

    <Directory /var/www/html/NextCloud/>
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride All
      Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews

      <IfModule mod_dav.c>
        Dav off
      </IfModule>

    </Directory>

    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
      Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains"
    </IfModule>

</VirtualHost>

sudo service apache2 restart

NOTE !!!!

Now the messages are gone if you logon to https://HOST/NextCloud
where HOST is ServerName or one of the ServerAlias values.
