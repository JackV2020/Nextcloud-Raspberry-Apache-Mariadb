These are my notes on installing Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi and getting a green checkmark on the Administration Overview page.

My last installation is in '00. Nextcloud 30.0.1 on Raspberry Pi 4 running Bookworm'.

All solutions to the issues I had right after finishing the installation are in that document.

Issues solved during installations and upgrades before are in other documents in the old notes folder.

Current version Nextcloud is 31.0.0

Issues after last installation:

    01. The database is missing some indices
    02. Mimetype Migration Issue After Updating to 31.0.0
