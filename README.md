These are my notes on installing Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi and getting a green checkmark on the Administration Overview page.

My last installation is in '00. Nextcloud 25.0.4 on Raspberry Pi 4 running Bullseye, mysql, apache and Let's Encrypt certificate'.

All solutions to the issues I had right after finishing the installation are in that document.

Issues solved during upgrades and previous installations are in other documents in the old notes folder.

Current version Nextcloud is 29.0.0

Issues after last installation:

    01. Fix Error Memcache  OC\Memcache\APCu not available
    02. Android - The document was saved outside the editor
    03. 29.0.0 Fix resolve caldav
    03. Old Fix resolve carddav and caldav
    04. The database is missing some indexes
    05. The database is used for transactional file locking
    06. Server has no maintenance window
    07. Could not check for JavaScript support.
