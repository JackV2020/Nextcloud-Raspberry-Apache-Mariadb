----- 10. Mimetype Migration Issue After Updating to 31.0.0

One or more mimetype migrations are available. Occasionally new mimetypes are added to better handle certain file types. Migrating the mimetypes take a long time on larger instances so this is not done automatically during upgrades. Use the command `occ maintenance:repair --include-expensive` to perform the migrations.

I ran the command below and refreshed my screen and the message was gone:

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ maintenance:repair --include-expensive
