----- The database is missing some primary keys

The database is missing some primary keys. 
Due to the fact that adding primary keys on big tables could take some time they were not added automatically. 
By running "occ db:add-missing-primary-keys" those missing primary keys could be added manually while the instance keeps running.

Note that the message indicates that this can be done online so :

	sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ db:add-missing-primary-keys

Click Overview in the left pane and the message does not show anymore.
