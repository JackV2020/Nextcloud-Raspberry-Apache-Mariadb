----- Web can not delete file

You find yourself in the web interface and can not delete a file

First check '08. File locked for delete.txt'

When that does not help continue below.

sudo -i
cd to the file location like :

    cd /folder/folder/Nextclouddatafolder/username/files[/subfolder[/subfolder...]]

Check if you see the file there :

    ls -l
    all files should be owned by www-data and security settings should be the same for all files.
    -rw-r--r--  1 www-data www-data

When this was ok or changing settings did not help....

Assume the name of the file is issue_file.something and move it to the login folder of root.

    mv issue_file.something ~/issue_file.something

Start a rescan for the user , username is case sensitive and should be the same as the user folder name:

    sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ files:scan Jack
It says :
    Starting scan for user 1 out of 1 (Jack)

My file was in the root folder of my web interface and was gone after I logged in again.

The script was still running so I left it running overnight.

Final message of the script :
    Starting scan for user 1 out of 1 (Jack)
