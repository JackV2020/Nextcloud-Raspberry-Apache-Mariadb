----- When editing a text file on laptop this does not work on Android anymore

When opening txt file on Android : "The document was saved outside the editor. The changes could not be applied."

See https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/11508

What works is first on my phone : sharing the file, saving it somewhere, delete from Nexcloud local and server version,
Synchronise my latop so it is deleted.
After this upload the saved file on my phone into the same location in Nextcloud.
Other laptopts which were down during this pick up the new file when started so no sync issues there.
