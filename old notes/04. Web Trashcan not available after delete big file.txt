----- Web Trashcan not available after delete big file

When you delete a big file on your Windows the file is removed but the trashcan in the web interface is not usable anymore.

In the logging you may see a message like : Trash bin: AbstractTrash::getSize() must be of the type integer, float returned

To fix this I did the next but do not do that anymore. ( What I do is 1 line further below )

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/nextcloud/occ trashbin:cleanup usernameofuserwithissue


To fix this 'permanently' I do the next after every upgrade (using info from error: AbstractTrash::getSize() ) :

	sudo geany /var/www/nextcloud/apps/files_trashbin/lib/Sabre/AbstractTrash.php

Change :


	public function getSize(): int {
		return $this->data->getSize();
	}

to force it to return an integer by inserting (int)  :

	public function getSize(): int {
	    return (int)$this->data->getSize();
	}


I also asked the Nextcloud team to include this in Nextcloud. Waiting on that.....
