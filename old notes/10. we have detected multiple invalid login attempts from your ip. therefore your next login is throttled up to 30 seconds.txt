----- we have detected multiple invalid login attempts from your ip. therefore your next login is throttled up to 30 seconds.

Option 1)

Login with management account on web interface from location where you can get in.
	top right circle > Settings > Security > Brute-force IP whitelist
When this option is not there you need to install the APP :
	top right circle > APPS > Security > Brute-force settings

Modify the whitelist:

Add LAN network like 192.168.2.0  24
Now you can get in from the LAN ( 24 is network mask 255.255.255.0 )

Add your public IP address like : 123.134.123.123 0
Now you can get in from the LAN ( 0 is network mask 255.255.255.255 )
Now you can get in from Internet

To see the entries in the database :
sudo mysql -u nextclouduser -p nextclouddb
select * from oc_appconfig where appid like '%brute%';

to see the invalid logins :
select * from oc_bruteforce_attempts;

get rid of the logins :
DELETE FROM oc_bruteforce_attempts; 
optionallly add WHERE ip = 'aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd'; 

Option 2)
sudo mysql -e "use nextclouddb;select * from oc_bruteforce_attempts;"
sudo mysql -e "use nextclouddb;delete from oc_bruteforce_attempts;"
sudo mysql -e "use nextclouddb;select * from oc_appconfig where appid like '%brute%';"


optionally shrink the database to free up sspace :
VACUUM;

Option last) just some  notes

restart ISP router
