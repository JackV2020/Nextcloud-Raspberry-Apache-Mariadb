----- 09. Mimetype Migration Issue After Updating to 29.0.5

One or more mimetype migrations are available. Occasionally new mimetypes are added to better handle certain file types. Migrating the mimetypes take a long time on larger instances so this is not done automatically during upgrades. Use the command `occ maintenance:repair --include-expensive` to perform the migrations.

I ran the command:

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ maintenance:repair --include-expensive

but the message did not go away.

Found the next link: https://help.nextcloud.com/t/mimetype-migration-issue-after-updating-to-29-0-5/201318

sudo -i

Edit cd/var/www/nextcloud/lib/private/Repair/RepairMimeTypes.php

Search for 30.0.0.0 and find 1 occurence.

Change that to 29.0.5.0, save file, refresh browser, message gone, issue still there?

Found other command :

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ integrity:check-core

  - INVALID_HASH:
    - lib/private/Repair/RepairMimeTypes.php:
      - expected: cbe37950a516bdaa081a318a5ea934c424c4fcd16d8690efdfa68a09241c553cdb41f3994a451dd20d69d15a6525f988e3fcb3668e8fb50f6f9afd60bc0aa9d1

Changed back to  30.0.0.0

sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ integrity:check-core

no issue, but message is back plus an integrity issue message which contains an option to rescan. Clicked the rescan and the integrity issue was gone.
