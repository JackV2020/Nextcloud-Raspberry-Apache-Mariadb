----- Security & setup warnings on caldav and carddav

I had the fix in place like described in '03.Old Fix resolve carddav and caldav'

After upgrade to 29.0.0 I see the next in the administration overview :

    Your web server is not properly set up to resolve .well-known URLs, failed on: /.well-known/caldav
    
Since I have no Alias to /var/www/nextcloud/ anymore ( to solve the security host prefix issue on https://scan.nextcloud.com/ )
I had the next in my /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf :

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/carddav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]
  RewriteRule ^(.*/\.well-known/caldav)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/remote.php/dav [R=301,L]

Now I disabled these and put the next in /var/www/nextcloud/.htaccess :

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} DavClnt
  RewriteRule ^$ /remote.php/webdav/ [L,R=302]
  RewriteRule .* - [env=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
  RewriteRule ^\.well-known/carddav /remote.php/dav/ [R=301,L]
  RewriteRule ^\.well-known/caldav /remote.php/dav/ [R=301,L]
  RewriteRule ^remote/(.*) remote.php [QSA,L]
  RewriteRule ^(?:build|tests|config|lib|3rdparty|templates)/.* - [R=404,L]
  RewriteRule ^\.well-known/(?!acme-challenge|pki-validation) /index.php [QSA,L]
  RewriteRule ^ocm-provider/?$ index.php [QSA,L]
  RewriteRule ^(?:\.(?!well-known)|autotest|occ|issue|indie|db_|console).* - [R=404,L]
</IfModule>
