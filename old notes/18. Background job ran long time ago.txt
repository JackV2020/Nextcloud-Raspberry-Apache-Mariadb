----- Warnings concerning background job ran long time ago

In the Administration Overview and Administration Basic settings you have messages about the background job.

I created a crontab job as documented in the Nextcloud documentation :

crontab -u www-data -e

and added the next line :

*/5  *  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php

Kept keeping issues and found a solution on :

# https://help.nextcloud.com/t/solved-last-background-job-execution-ran-8-days-ago/121082

and changed it to :

*/5  *  *  *  * php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php --define apc.enable_cli=1

Later found a warning in the Nextcloud docu where cache setup is explained :

    https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_server/caching_configuration.html

    At the end of the section about APCu :

    Warning

    APCu is disabled by default on CLI which could cause issues with nextcloudâ€™s cron jobs. 
    Please make sure you set the apc.enable_cli to 1 on your php.ini config file or append
    --define apc.enable_cli=1 to the cron job call.

So the fix is fine 8-)
