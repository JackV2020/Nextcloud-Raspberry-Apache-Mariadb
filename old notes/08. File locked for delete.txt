----- File locked for delete

Check if there are any locks :

sudo mysql -e "use nextclouddb;SELECT * FROM oc_file_locks WHERE oc_file_locks.lock = 1;"
When there are no locks there is no output.

put Nextcloud in maintenance mode: 

	sudo geany /var/www/html/nextcloud/config/config.php &

and change this line:
'maintenance' => true,
and save file

	sudo mysql -u nextclouduser -p nextclouddb
    enter password of your db user named nextclouduser

	SELECT * FROM oc_file_locks WHERE oc_file_locks.lock = 1;
	and see locks

	DELETE FROM oc_file_locks WHERE oc_file_locks.lock = 1;
	notice the number of rows affected

	SELECT * FROM oc_file_locks WHERE oc_file_locks.lock = 1;
	no more locks

disable file locking : 

	sudo geany /var/www/html/nextcloud/config/config/config.php &

and add this line 

'filelocking.enabled'=> false,
and save file

take out of maintenance :
'maintenance' => false,

save file

now do file cleanup :
 - delete file from web page, 
 - or login to nextcloud web page 
 - or phone app with user account
 - just locate file and delete it.

now using steps like above :

'maintenance' => true,
save file

'filelocking.enabled'=> true, or remove this line
save file

'maintenance' => false,
save file
